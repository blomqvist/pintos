## Usage
Please use this material responsible.

 1. The code quality is not that good
 2. It does not run "Pintos run forever".. forever.
 3. Use this a pointer (0xDEADBEEF) when you get stuck with your assignment

## Student?
Do not cheat. Pintos is probably one of the best courses you will ever read. If this course is to hard for you - try to learn it! If you can't - switch program. Filfak, perhaps?

## Teacher, TA or such?
No - I will not take this repository down. If your students cheat - it's their loss. Tell them "good luck finding a job".
